Create an experimental composition that incorporates elements of serialism, spectralism, and complex polyrhythms. The piece should be challenging to perform but rewarding to listen to. Use extreme dynamic contrasts and explore the full range of the instruments. Include at least one section that features aleatoric (chance-based) elements within controlled parameters. The piece should convey a sense of dramatic tension throughout.
