I want this piece to be further developed and significantly longer. Please add:

1. A new middle section that serves as a dramatic breakdown with unusual chord progressions
2. Extend the piece by repeating the main theme with variations and embellishments
3. Add a more elaborate ending with a gradual build-up to a climactic finale
4. Incorporate more dynamic contrast throughout the piece
5. If any instruments are soloing, add more virtuosic passages 
6. Add at least 32 additional measures to the overall length
